# Introduction

The ever-growing popularity of online gaming demands robust data management solutions to handle real-time updates, complex interactions, and diverse player data.

This project challenges us to design a data model for an online gaming platform with leaderboards, utilizing a combination of multiple data management systems (**DBMS**).

This project outlines the data requirements for an online gaming platform featuring real-time leaderboards and a rich user experience.

## 1. Player Data `PlayerProfiles.py` (Cassandra)
The idea behind this script is to manage player profiles within a game. Player profiles include details such as achievements, email, friend list, inventory, profile picture, username, and password.


### Present Tables

#### player_profiles
Let's start with the foundation: the table that will serve as the basis for storing our players' profiles. It consists of the following fields:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS player_profiles (
    player_id int PRIMARY KEY,
    achievements list<text>,
    email text,
    friend_list map<int, text>,
    inventory map<text, int>,
    profile_picture text,
    username text,
    password text
)
```

- Purpose: To store detailed player profiles including achievements, email, friend list, inventory, profile picture, username, and password.
- Rationale:
    - Cassandra's Strength: Apache Cassandra is chosen for this because it excels at handling large volumes of data and provides high availability with its distributed architecture.
    - Use Case Fit: Player profiles are relatively static and do not require frequent updates, making Cassandra a good fit for this type of data.

</details>

## 2. Game Data `Game_Info_Handler.py` (Cassandra)
Every game needs to have its own tables so that we can distingues the various games that our company could create/develop.

### Game Info Table
This is the table that houses the various games our company could establish so that we can easily track their different aspects.

Its datatypes are:
```sql
CREATE TABLE GameInfo (
    game_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    type TEXT,
    current_state TEXT,
    world_layout TEXT
);
```

- Purpose: To store information about various games developed by the company.
- Rationale:
    - High Availability and Scalability: Cassandra provides the necessary scalability to handle data for potentially numerous games.
    - Consistency: The relatively static nature of game info means strong consistency requirements can be relaxed.

## 3. Game Object Data `Game_Object_Handler.py` (Cassandra)
As we need to have for each game its own attributes we need to have for each object in the game their own attributes as well.

Its datatypes are:
### Game Object Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE GameObject (
    game_id UUID,
    object_id TEXT,
    type TEXT,
    position_x INT,
    position_y INT,
    position_z INT,
    attributes MAP<TEXT, TEXT>,
    PRIMARY KEY (game_id, object_id)
);
```

- Purpose: To store attributes and positions of game objects within each game.
- Rationale:
    - Scalable Data Model: Each game can have many objects, and Cassandraâ€™s wide-row storage model fits well with this requirement.

## 4. Game State Data (Real-Time Updates) `real_time_stats.py` (Redis)

Real time updates is an essential key aspect of any game, as we need to continuasly know where certain valubale items are and not only items but also the player to be able to execute certain formulas like generating the enemy spawn zone or calculating their view distance.

As such we choose to contain these valubale information in the Redis DBMS as its read/write execution is really fast and is perfect for what we want to achieve.

### Present Tables

#### Player Location
This part houses the location of a player. The directory of the folder that houses all the player locations are in `game:players:player:<player_id>:location`.

It's data type is:
```js
'position': {
    str: int
},
'timestamp': timestamp
```

#### Game Events
This part houses all the game events triggered by the player, which is currently only concerned with `'item_pickup'` or `'enemy_defeated'`. The directory of the folder that houses all the events are in `game:event:<event_id>`.

It's data type is:
```js
'event_id': uuid4
'event_type': str
'player_id': int
'details': {
    str: str
}
'timestamp': timestamp
```

#### World Resource
This part houses the data of the world resources. The directory of the folder that houses all the world resources are in `game:world:resource:<resource_id>`.

It's data type is:
```js
'type': str,
'quantity': int,
'location': {
    str: int
},
'timestamp': timestamp
```

- Purpose: To store real-time data for player locations, game events, and world resources.
- Rationale:
    - Low Latency: Redis is used for real-time updates due to its low-latency data access and high-speed read/write capabilities.
    - In-Memory Storage: The in-memory nature of Redis ensures quick access and updates, which is crucial for real-time game state management.

It's data type is:
```js
`guild_name`: str
'member_count': int
'members': [
    {str: any}
]
'decription': str

## 7. Player Statistics `PlayerStatistics.py` (Cassandra)
The idea behind this script is to create a system for tracking and managing player statistics within a game. By storing metrics such as combat performance, resource management, and progression in a database, the game can provide a more immersive and personalized experience for players. These statistics can be used to enhance gameplay features such as leaderboards, achievements, and personalized feedback. 

### Present Tables

#### player_statistics
Let's begin with the foundation: the table that will serve as the basis for tracking our players' progress. 
It's data type is:

```sql 
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS player_statistics (
    player_id int PRIMARY KEY,
    combat_stats map<text, int>,
    resource_stats map<text, int>,
    progression_stats map<text, int>
)
```

- Purpose: To track and manage player statistics within the game.
- Rationale:
    - Scalability and Availability: Cassandra's architecture is suitable for handling large volumes of statistical data across numerous players.
    - Flexibility: The use of maps allows for flexible addition and modification of various statistics without altering the table schema.

Its data type is:
```sql
CREATE TABLE ResourceUtilization (
    resource_id UUID,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    resource_type TEXT,
    usage_metrics MAP<TEXT, DOUBLE>,
    PRIMARY KEY (resource_id, timestamp)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (timestamp DESC);
```

- Purpose: To collect and analyze game events and resource utilization data for insights and optimization.
